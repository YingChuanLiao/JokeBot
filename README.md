Hello there!

This is jokebot I created. Here I would like to briefly explain my codes :)

1. I fetch jokes by two methods: the first one is to use public joke API (I think jokes from it is not really funny though.)
2. Another is to crawl a website which contains joke by a package called cheerio.
In the first place I would like to crawl jokes in real time but I found out that sometimes it doesn't work. So I just save it to txt file.
